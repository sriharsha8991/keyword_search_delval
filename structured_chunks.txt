Design considerations mentioned below shall also be followed. Instrument and Control equipment shall be designed to operate at the temperatures specified below according to the three types of location shown below: INDOOR AIRCONDITIONED(2) OUTDOOR SHELTERED (1)(2)(3) OUTDOOR UNSHELTERED (2)(3) Maximum 35°C (95°F) 55°C (131°F) 65°C (149°F) Minimum 10°C (50°F) 0°C (32°F) 0°C (32°F) Notes: 1. "Sheltered" refers to permanent, ventilated enclosures or buildings, or permanently fixed sunshades with a top and three sides. 2. For instruments which dissipate internal heat and are installed in custom engineered enclosures (e.g., enclosures not included in the original manufacturer's temperature certification), an additional 15°C shall be added to the above maximum temperatures. An example, for "indoor air conditioned" installation, the equipment must perform at 35 + 15 = 50°C. Similarly, for the "outdoor unsheltered" case, the equipment shall be designed for a maximum operating temperature of 65 + 15 = 80°C.

No: 217601C-000-JSS-1580-0001 6.2 ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS The environmental conditions shall be as per Instrument & Control Design Basis (Doc. No. E1150-BD-2000-J-0001) All the Instruments and Control system equipment shall be designed suitable for installation under the above environmental conditions. Design considerations mentioned below shall also be followed. Instrument and Control equipment shall be designed to operate for the applicable three types of location shown below: INDOOR AIRCONDITIONED (2) OUTDOOR SHELTERED (1)(2)(3) OUTDOOR UNSHELTERED (2)(3) Maximum 35°C (95°F) 55°C (131°F) 65°C (149°F) Minimum 10°C (50°F) 0°C (32°F) 0°C (32°F) Notes: 1 "Sheltered" refers to permanent, ventilated enclosures or buildings or permanently fixed sunshades with a top and three sides. 2 For instruments which dissipate internal heat and are installed in custom engineered enclosures (e.g., enclosures not included in the original manufacturer's temperature certification), an additional 15°C shall be added to the above maximum temperatures. An example, for "indoor air conditioned" installation, the equipment must perform at 35 + 15 = 50°C. Similarly, for the "outdoor unsheltered" case, the equipment shall be designed for a maximum operating temperature of 65 + 15 = 80°C. 3 For the outdoor installations only, the designer can take credit for forced or passive cooling to eliminate or reduce the 15°C heat rise. For example, if vortex coolers are used, the heat removal capacity of the coolers may be subtracted from the generated heat. No more than 15°C reduction in temperature will be given as credit. The designer shall substantiate his claim by providing the support data and calculations. 6.3 SIGNAL STANDARDS AND TYPES 6.3.1 Pneumatic and Electronic Transmission Signals Pneumatic and Electronic transmission signals shall be as follows: • Pneumatic: 3-15 psig / 0.2-1.0 bar g • Electronic a) Foundation Fieldbus (FF) compatible instruments (connected to BPCS) b) 2-wire, 4-20 mA, 24 V dc, with HART protocol (connected to Package Control Systems, SIS, CCS, RMMS etc.)
